            <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Betty White's life:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1922</strong> - Born in Oak Park, Illinois</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1949</strong> - After the war, White made the rounds to movie studios looking for work, but
                    was turned down because she was "not photogenic". She started to look for radio jobs, where being
                    photogenic did not matter.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1952</strong> - White hosted and produced her own daily talk/variety show, The Betty White
                    Show, first on KLAC-TV and then on NBC (her first television, but second show to feature that
                    title).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1960s</strong> - White was a staple of network game shows and talk shows: including both
                    Jack Paar and later Johnny Carson's era of The Tonight Show. She made many appearances on the hit
                    Password show as a celebrity guest from 1961 through 1975. She married the show's host, Allen
                    Ludden, in 1963.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1970s</strong> - White made several appearances in the fourth season (1973–74) of The Mary
                    Tyler Moore Show, as the "man-hungry" Sue Ann Nivens. Although considering the role a highlight of
                    her career, White described the character's image as "icky sweet", feeling she was the very
                    definition of feminine passivity, owing to the fact she always satirized her own persona onscreen in
                    just such a way. The Mary Tyler Moore Show's producers made Sue Ann Nivens a regular character and
                    brought White into the main cast starting with the fifth season, after Valerie Harper, who played
                    Rhoda Morgenstern, left the program.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1983</strong> - White became the first woman to win a Daytime Emmy Award in the category of
                    Outstanding Game Show Host, for the NBC entry Just Men! Due to the amount of work she did on them,
                    she was deemed the "First Lady of Game Shows".
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1985</strong> - White scored her second signature role and the biggest hit of her career as
                    the St. Olaf, Minnesota native Rose Nylund on The Golden Girls. The series chronicled the lives of
                    four widowed or divorced women in their "golden years" who shared a home in Miami.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1992</strong> - The Golden Girls ended in 1992 after Arthur announced her decision to depart
                    the series. White, McClanahan, and Getty reprised their roles as Rose, Blanche, and Sophia in the
                    spin-off The Golden Palace. The series was short-lived, lasting only one season. In addition, White
                    reprised her Rose Nylund character in guest appearances on the NBC shows Empty Nest and Nurses, both
                    set in Miami.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>2009</strong> - White starred in the romantic comedy The Proposal alongside Sandra Bullock
                    and Ryan Reynolds. Also in 2009, the candy company Mars, Incorporated launched a global campaign for
                    their Snickers bar; the campaign's slogan was: "You're not you when you're hungry". White appeared,
                    alongside Abe Vigoda, in the company's advertisement for the candy during the 2010 Super Bowl XLIV.
                    The advertisement became very popular, and won the top spot on the Super Bowl Ad Meter.

                <li>
                    <strong>2010</strong> - Following the success of the Snickers advertisement, a grassroots campaign
                    on Facebook called "Betty White to Host SNL (Please)" began in January 2010. The group was
                    approaching 500,000 members when NBC confirmed on March 11, 2010, that White would in fact host
                    Saturday Night Live on May 8. The appearance made her, at age 88, the oldest person to host the
                    show, beating Miskel Spillman, the winner of SNL's "Anybody Can Host" contest, who was 80 when she
                    hosted in 1977.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>2010</strong> - In June 2010, White took on the role of Elka Ostrovsky, the house caretaker
                    on TV Land's original sitcom Hot in Cleveland along with Valerie Bertinelli, Jane Leeves, and Wendie
                    Malick. Hot in Cleveland was TV Land's first attempt at a first-run scripted comedy (the channel has
                    rerun other sitcoms since its debut). White was only meant to appear in the pilot of the show but
                    was asked to stay on for the entire series.
                </li>
                <li><strong>2015</strong> - On February 15, White made her final appearance on Saturday Night Live when
                    she attended the 40th Anniversary Special. She participated in "The Californians" sketch alongside
                    members of the current SNL cast members as well as Bill Hader, Taylor Swift and Kerry Washington. In
                    the memorable sketch White ends up kissing Bradley Cooper.</li>

                </li>
